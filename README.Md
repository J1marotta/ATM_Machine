This is my atm machine program, for a challenge Friday august 3rd 2017
at Code Academy.

Our main conditions are to accept withdrawals,
 deposits , display balance and use a pin.

I've added sound but was yet unable to get classes to work properly
so I had to use a global variable, which I know is bad practice

please put police.txt in the same directory to maximise effect.
